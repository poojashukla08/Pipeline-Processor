Task: 4-Stage Pipeline Processor Performing Basic Operations Like ADD, SUB, and LOAD

### Overview

This project implements a **4-stage pipelined processor** using **Verilog HDL**, capable of executing fundamental instructions such as `ADD`, `SUB`, and `LOAD`. The processor is designed to simulate instruction-level parallelism through pipelining, improving execution throughput over a non-pipelined design. The design and simulation are implemented and verified using **EDA Playground**, a free online platform for HDL development and waveform visualization.

The processor includes a complete testbench and is organized for simulation, waveform generation, and verification of functional correctness.

###  Objectives

The main goal of this task is to develop and verify a basic pipelined processor with a clean architectural pipeline consisting of the following four stages:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF):** Fetches instructions from instruction memory based on the current program counter (PC).
2. **Instruction Decode/Register Fetch (ID):** Decodes the instruction and reads operands from the register file.
3. **Execute (EX):** Performs arithmetic or memory address calculation operations.
4. **Write Back (WB):** Writes results back to the register file.

This architecture demonstrates how pipeline registers between stages manage data flow and simulate real-world CPU behavior with multiple instructions executing concurrently in different stages.

###  Features

* **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**:

  * `ADD rd, rs1, rs2`: Performs register-to-register addition.
  * `SUB rd, rs1, rs2`: Performs register-to-register subtraction.
  * `LOAD rd, rs1, imm`: Loads data from memory at `rs1 + imm` into `rd`.

* **16-bit instruction format**:

  ```
  [15:12] Opcode
  [11:8]  Destination Register (rd)
  [7:4]   Source Register 1 (rs1)
  [3:0]   Source Register 2 or Immediate (rs2/imm)
  ```

* **16 general-purpose 16-bit registers**

* **256-word instruction memory and data memory**

* **Simulated pipeline registers for stage transitions**

* **Waveform generation using `$dumpfile` and `$dumpvars` for analysis in EPWave viewer**

---

### Testbench & Simulation (EDA Playground)

The processor is tested using a custom **testbench (`tb_cpu.v`)** written in Verilog and run on **EDA Playground**. The testbench initializes registers and memory with test data and loads a set of instructions into the instruction memory to simulate processor behavior over several clock cycles.

Key test instructions:

* `ADD R1, R2, R3` â†’ Verifies arithmetic addition
* `SUB R4, R1, R2` â†’ Verifies subtraction using result of previous instruction
* `LOAD R5, R6, 4` â†’ Verifies memory access using address computation

Waveforms are automatically generated during simulation using EDA Playgroundâ€™s **EPWave viewer**, enabling easy observation of signal transitions through the pipeline and validation of data flow between stages.
